# Scatter Plot Plugin

This repository contains code for making scatter plots using a combination of 
HTML5 canvas elements and [D3.js](https://d3js.org/).


This repo is designed to be a plugin for the [NG-CHM](https://github.com/MD-Anderson-Bioinformatics/NG-CHM) system.

The code is simple HTML and Javascript, and can be served by a standard web server.
